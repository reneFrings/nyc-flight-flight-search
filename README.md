# new-york-travel-tour/flight/flight-search

A React App for a flight search, composed of various components such as <Searchbar />, <SearchbarButton />, <Feed /> and <FeedItem />. The search results respond directly to the input in the search box, just like the button that displays only nonstop flights. Currently, the data is still obtained from a static file. The file contains an array with the records as objects.
